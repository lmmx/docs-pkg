!!! info inline end "What is autodocs?"
    
    As the name suggests, _autodocs_ means that if you write docstrings in your code
    they will be automatically turned into docs by using the following syntax:

    ```
    ::: docs_pkg.foo
    ```

    In that case it would document the `foo` module of the `docs_pkg` package.

    In mkdocs the autodocs framework is
    [mkdocstrings](https://mkdocstrings.github.io/#quick-usage).

This section contains API documentation using the `mkdocstrings` autodoc framework.
